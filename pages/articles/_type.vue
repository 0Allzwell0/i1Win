            >i1Win.com is committed to responsible gambling. Remote gambling is a legitimate form of entertainment that is experienced by millions of players worldwide. For most players remote gambling is an enjoyable experience, however, the reality must be accepted that a small percentage of players engaging in remote gambling might be underage or might have a problem with gambling taking over their life and finances.</p>

            <h3 class="info-subtitle">Under Age Gambling</h3>
            <p class="info-paragraph">
                You must be over 18 years of age to register or to place a bet and it is an offence for anyone under the age of 18 to place a bet or register, in an attempt to place a bet.
                <br />i1Win.com has sophisticated software and procedures in place to minimise the risk of underage customers placing bets. If we have any doubt about the legality of any customer attempting to register or place bets, we will conduct further age verification checks and may require documentary evidence to confirm the age of the applicant. During this period of age verification, no winnings will be paid to any customer.
            </p>
            <p class="info-paragraph">
                If age verification has not been satisfactorily completed within 72 hours of the application to register, and gamble with deposited funds, the following will apply;The account will be frozen. No further gambling will be permitted until age verification has been successfully completed and;
                <br />If on completion of age verification the customer is shown to be underage all stakes will be returned to the customer, and no winnings paid.

            >On request, i1Win.com will close any customer's account(s) for a minimum period of six months and for any period up to 5 years. During the agreed period of time the customer will not be able to place any bets nor will the customer be allowed to revoke the agreement. i1Win.com will remove the customer's name from our mailing and marketing lists and will do everything it can to prevent a new account from an excluded customer from being re-opened during the period of self-exclusion.</p>
            <p
                class="info-paragraph"
            >In order to exclude yourself, you will need to inform i1Win.com in writing of your intentions. You can do this by filling out a self-exclusion agreement form, available from the link below and sending it to us via email at help@ i1Win.com . Alternatively, contact our customer services department and they will advise you on how you can proceed with any request.</p>
            <p

            <p class="info-paragraph">Please bear in mind the following;</p>
            <ul class="info-paragraph">
                <li>A self-exclusion agreement cannot be revoked.</li>
